                    This is my on going web programming project as well as my personal blog and photo. Please bare with me as a lot of things will look out of place
                as I progress my knowledge with web technologies and my understanding on how to implement them in a way that I find useful and aesthetically pleasing.
                Thanks for stopping by and if you have any suggestions don't hesitate to contact me.
